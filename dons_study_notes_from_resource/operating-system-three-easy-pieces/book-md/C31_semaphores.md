As we know now, one needs both locks and condition variables to solve a broad range of relevant and interesting concurrency problems. One of the first people to realize this years ago was Edsger Dijkstra (though it is hard to know the exact history [GR92]), known among other things for his famous “shortest paths” algorithm in graph theory [D59], an early polemic on structured programming entitled “Goto Statements Considered Harmful” [D68a] (what a great title!), and, in the case we will study here, the introduction of a synchronization primitive called the semaphore [D68b,D72]. Indeed, Dijkstra and colleagues invented the semaphore as a single primitive for all things related to synchronization; as you will see, one can use semaphores as both locks and condition variables.

## 31.1 Semaphores: A Definition

A semaphore is an object with an integer value that we can manipulate with two routines; in the POSIX standard, these routines are sem wait() and sem post()1 . Because the initial value of the semaphore determines its behavior, before calling any other routine to interact with the semaphore, we must first initialize it to some value, as the code in Figure 31.1 does.

Historically, sem wait() was called P() by Dijkstra and sem post() called V(). P() comes from “prolaag”, a contraction of “probeer” (Dutch for “try”) and “verlaag” (“decrease”); V() comes from the Dutch word “verhoog” which means “increase” (thanks to Mart Oskamp for this information). Sometimes, people call them down and up. Use the Dutch versions to impress your friends, or confuse them, or both.

```c
1     #include <semaphore.h>
2     sem_t s;
3     sem_init(&s, 0, 1);
```
*Figure 31.1: Initializing A Semaphore*

In the figure, we declare a semaphore s and initialize it to the value 1 by passing 1 in as the third argument. The second argument to sem init() will be set to 0 in all of the examples we’ll see; this indicates that the semaphore is shared between threads in the same process. See the man page for details on other usages of semaphores (namely, how they can be used to synchronize access across different processes), which require a different value for that second argument.

After a semaphore is initialized, we can call one of two functions to interact with it, sem wait() or sem post(). The behavior of these two functions is seen in Figure 31.2.

For now, we are not concerned with the implementation of these routines, which clearly requires some care; with multiple threads calling into sem wait() and sem post(), there is the obvious need for managing

```c
these critical sections. We will now focus on how to use these primitives;
later we may discuss how they are built.
```

We should discuss a few salient aspects of the interfaces here. First, we can see that sem wait() will either return right away (because the value of the semaphore was one or higher when we called sem wait()), or it will cause the caller to suspend execution waiting for a subsequent post. Of course, multiple calling threads may call into sem wait(), and thus all be queued waiting to be woken.

Second, we can see that sem post() does not wait for some particular condition to hold like sem wait() does. Rather, it simply increments the value of the semaphore and then, if there is a thread waiting to be woken, wakes one of them up.

Third, the value of the semaphore, when negative, is equal to the number of waiting threads [D68b]. Though the value generally isn’t seen by users of the semaphores, this invariant is worth knowing and perhaps can help you remember how a semaphore functions.

Don’t worry (yet) about the seeming race conditions possible within the semaphore; assume that the actions they make are performed atomically. We will soon use locks and condition variables to do just this.

```c
1     int sem_wait(sem_t *s) {
2         decrement the value of semaphore s by one
3         wait if value of semaphore s is negative
4     }
6     int sem_post(sem_t *s) {
7         increment the value of semaphore s by one
8         if there are one or more threads waiting, wake one
9     }
```
*Figure 31.2: Semaphore: Definitions Of Wait And Post*

```c
1   sem_t m;
2   sem_init(&m, 0, X); // initialize semaphore to X; what should X be?
4   sem_wait(&m);
5   // critical section here
6   sem_post(&m);
```
*Figure 31.3: A Binary Semaphore (That Is, A Lock)*

## 31.2 Binary Semaphores (Locks)

We are now ready to use a semaphore. Our first use will be one with which we are already familiar: using a semaphore as a lock. See Figure 31.3 for a code snippet; therein, you’ll see that we simply surround the critical section of interest with a sem wait()/sem post() pair. Critical to making this work, though, is the initial value of the semaphore m (initialized to X in the figure). What should X be?

... (Try thinking about it before going on) ...

Looking back at definition of the sem wait() and sem post() routines above, we can see that the initial value should be 1.

To make this clear, let’s imagine a scenario with two threads. The first thread (Thread 0) calls sem wait(); it will first decrement the value of the semaphore, changing it to 0. Then, it will wait only if the value is not greater than or equal to 0. Because the value is 0, sem wait() will simply return and the calling thread will continue; Thread 0 is now free to enter the critical section. If no other thread tries to acquire the lock while Thread 0 is inside the critical section, when it calls sem post(), it will simply restore the value of the semaphore to 1 (and not wake a waiting thread, because there are none). Figure 31.4 shows a trace of this scenario.

A more interesting case arises when Thread 0 “holds the lock” (i.e., it has called sem wait() but not yet called sem post()), and another thread (Thread 1) tries to enter the critical section by calling sem wait(). In this case, Thread 1 will decrement the value of the semaphore to -1, and thus wait (putting itself to sleep and relinquishing the processor). When Thread 0 runs again, it will eventually call sem post(), incrementing the value of the semaphore back to zero, and then wake the waiting thread (Thread 1), which will then be able to acquire the lock for itself. When Thread 1 finishes, it will again increment the value of the semaphore, restoring it to 1 again.

                     1            call sem wait()
                     0            sem wait() returns
                     0            (crit sect)
                     0            call sem post()
                     1            sem post() returns
```

     1                              Ready     sem post() returns   Running
```
*Figure 31.5: Thread Trace: Two Threads Using A Semaphore*

Figure 31.5 shows a trace of this example. In addition to thread actions, the figure shows the scheduler state of each thread: Running, Ready (i.e., runnable but not running), and Sleeping. Note in particular that Thread 1

```c
goes into the sleeping state when it tries to acquire the already-held lock;
```

only when Thread 0 runs again can Thread 1 be awoken and potentially run again.

If you want to work through your own example, try a scenario where multiple threads queue up waiting for a lock. What would the value of the semaphore be during such a trace?

Thus we are able to use semaphores as locks. Because locks only have two states (held and not held), we sometimes call a semaphore used as a lock a binary semaphore. Note that if you are using a semaphore only in this binary fashion, it could be implemented in a simpler manner than the generalized semaphores we present here.

## 31.3 Semaphores As Condition Variables

Semaphores are also useful when a thread wants to halt its progress waiting for a condition to become true. For example, a thread may wish to wait for a list to become non-empty, so it can delete an element from it. In this pattern of usage, we often find a thread waiting for something to happen, and a different thread making that something happen and then signaling that it has happened, thus waking the waiting thread. Because the waiting thread (or threads) is waiting for some condition in the program to change, we are using the semaphore as a condition variable.

```c
1   sem_t s;
3   void *
4   child(void *arg) {
5       printf("child\n");
6       sem_post(&s); // signal here: child is done
7       return NULL;
8   }
10   int
11   main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
12       sem_init(&s, 0, X); // what should X be?
13       printf("parent: begin\n");
14       pthread_t c;
15       Pthread_create(c, NULL, child, NULL);
16       sem_wait(&s); // wait here for child
17       printf("parent: end\n");
18       return 0;
19   }
```
*Figure 31.6: A Parent Waiting For Its Child*

A simple example is as follows. Imagine a thread creates another thread and then wants to wait for it to complete its execution (Figure 31.6). When this program runs, we would like to see the following: parent: begin child parent: end

The question, then, is how to use a semaphore to achieve this effect; as it turns out, the answer is relatively easy to understand. As you can see in the code, the parent simply calls sem wait() and the child sem post() to wait for the condition of the child finishing its execution to become true. However, this raises the question: what should the initial value of this semaphore be?

(Again, think about it here, instead of reading ahead)

The answer, of course, is that the value of the semaphore should be set to is 0. There are two cases to consider. First, let us assume that the parent creates the child but the child has not run yet (i.e., it is sitting in a ready queue but not running). In this case (Figure 31.7, page 6), the parent will call sem wait() before the child has called sem post(); we’d like the parent to wait for the child to run. The only way this will happen is if the value of the semaphore is not greater than 0; hence, 0 is the initial value. The parent runs, decrements the semaphore (to -1), then waits (sleeping). When the child finally runs, it will call sem post(), increment the value of the semaphore to 0, and wake the parent, which will then return from sem wait() and finish the program.

The second case (Figure 31.8, page 6) occurs when the child runs to completion before the parent gets a chance to call sem wait(). In this case, the child will first call sem post(), thus incrementing the value of the semaphore from 0 to 1. When the parent then gets a chance to run, it will call sem wait() and find the value of the semaphore to be 1; the parent will thus decrement the value (to 0) and return from sem wait() without waiting, also achieving the desired effect.

## 31.4 The Producer/Consumer (Bounded Buffer) Problem

The next problem we will confront in this chapter is known as the producer/consumer problem, or sometimes as the bounded buffer problem [D72]. This problem is described in detail in the previous chapter on condition variables; see there for details.

First Attempt Our first attempt at solving the problem introduces two semaphores, empty and full, which the threads will use to indicate when a buffer entry has been emptied or filled, respectively. The code for the put and get routines is in Figure 31.9, and our attempt at solving the producer and consumer problem is in Figure 31.10.

In this example, the producer first waits for a buffer to become empty in order to put data into it, and the consumer similarly waits for a buffer to become filled before using it. Let us first imagine that MAX=1 (there is only one buffer in the array), and see if this works.

Imagine again there are two threads, a producer and a consumer. Let us examine a specific scenario on a single CPU. Assume the consumer gets to run first. Thus, the consumer will hit line c1 in the figure above, calling sem wait(&full). Because full was initialized to the value 0,

```c
 1   int buffer[MAX];
 2   int fill = 0;
 3   int use = 0;
 5   void put(int value) {
 6       buffer[fill] = value;    // line f1
 7       fill = (fill + 1) % MAX; // line f2
 8   }
10   int get() {
11       int tmp = buffer[use];      // line g1
12       use = (use + 1) % MAX;      // line g2
13       return tmp;
14   }
```
*Figure 31.9: The Put And Get Routines*

```c
 1   sem_t empty;
 2   sem_t full;
 4   void *producer(void *arg) {
 5       int i;
 6       for (i = 0; i < loops; i++) {
 7           sem_wait(&empty);              // line P1
 8           put(i);                        // line P2
 9           sem_post(&full);               // line P3
10       }
11   }
13   void *consumer(void *arg) {
14       int i, tmp = 0;
15       while (tmp != -1) {
16           sem_wait(&full);               // line C1
17           tmp = get();                   // line C2
18           sem_post(&empty);              // line C3
19           printf("%d\n", tmp);
20       }
21   }
23   int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
24       // ...
25       sem_init(&empty, 0, MAX); // MAX buffers are empty to begin with...
26       sem_init(&full, 0, 0);    // ... and 0 are full
27       // ...
28   }
```
*Figure 31.10: Adding The Full And Empty Conditions*

the call will decrement full (to -1), block the consumer, and wait for

another thread to call sem post() on full, as desired.

Assume the producer then runs. It will hit line P1, thus calling the

sem wait(&empty) routine. Unlike the consumer, the producer will

continue through this line, because empty was initialized to the value

MAX (in this case, 1). Thus, empty will be decremented to 0 and the

producer will put a data value into the first entry of buffer (line P2). The

producer will then continue on to P3 and call sem post(&full), chang-

ing the value of the full semaphore from -1 to 0 and waking the consumer

(e.g., move it from blocked to ready).

In this case, one of two things could happen. If the producer continues to run, it will loop around and hit line P1 again. This time, however, it would block, as the empty semaphore’s value is 0. If the producer instead was interrupted and the consumer began to run, it would call sem wait(&full) (line c1) and find that the buffer was indeed full and thus consume it. In either case, we achieve the desired behavior.

You can try this same example with more threads (e.g., multiple producers, and multiple consumers). It should still work.

Let us now imagine that MAX is greater than 1 (say MAX = 10). For this example, let us assume that there are multiple producers and multiple consumers. We now have a problem: a race condition. Do you see where it occurs? (take some time and look for it) If you can’t see it, here’s a hint: look more closely at the put() and get() code.

OK, let’s understand the issue. Imagine two producers (Pa and Pb) both calling into put() at roughly the same time. Assume producer Pa gets to run first, and just starts to fill the first buffer entry (fill = 0 at line f1). Before Pa gets a chance to increment the fill counter to 1, it is interrupted. Producer Pb starts to run, and at line f1 it also puts its data into the 0th element of buffer, which means that the old data there is overwritten! This is a no-no; we don’t want any data from the producer to be lost.

A Solution: Adding Mutual Exclusion

As you can see, what we’ve forgotten here is mutual exclusion. The filling of a buffer and incrementing of the index into the buffer is a critical section, and thus must be guarded carefully. So let’s use our friend the binary semaphore and add some locks. Figure 31.11 shows our attempt.

Now we’ve added some locks around the entire put()/get() parts of the code, as indicated by the NEW LINE comments. That seems like the right idea, but it also doesn’t work. Why? Deadlock. Why does deadlock occur? Take a moment to consider it; try to find a case where deadlock arises. What sequence of steps must happen for the program to deadlock?

Avoiding Deadlock OK, now that you figured it out, here is the answer. Imagine two threads, one producer and one consumer. The consumer gets to run first. It acquires the mutex (line c0), and then calls sem wait() on the full semaphore (line c1); because there is no data yet, this call causes the consumer to block and thus yield the CPU; importantly, though, the consumer still holds the lock.

A producer then runs. It has data to produce and if it were able to run, it would be able to wake the consumer thread and all would be good. Unfortunately, the first thing it does is call sem wait() on the binary mutex semaphore (line p0). The lock is already held. Hence, the producer is now stuck waiting too.

```c
 1   sem_t empty;
 2   sem_t full;
 3   sem_t mutex;
 5   void *producer(void *arg) {
 6       int i;
 7       for (i = 0; i < loops; i++) {
 8           sem_wait(&mutex);             // line p0 (NEW LINE)
 9           sem_wait(&empty);             // line p1
10           put(i);                       // line p2
11           sem_post(&full);              // line p3
12           sem_post(&mutex);             // line p4 (NEW LINE)
13       }
14   }
16   void *consumer(void *arg) {
17       int i;
18       for (i = 0; i < loops; i++) {
19           sem_wait(&mutex);             // line c0 (NEW LINE)
20           sem_wait(&full);              // line c1
21           int tmp = get();              // line c2
22           sem_post(&empty);             // line c3
23           sem_post(&mutex);             // line c4 (NEW LINE)
24           printf("%d\n", tmp);
25       }
26   }
28   int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
29       // ...
30       sem_init(&empty, 0, MAX); // MAX buffers are empty to begin with...
31       sem_init(&full, 0, 0);    // ... and 0 are full
32       sem_init(&mutex, 0, 1);   // mutex=1 because it is a lock (NEW LINE)
33       // ...
34   }
```
*Figure 31.11: Adding Mutual Exclusion (Incorrectly)*

There is a simple cycle here. The consumer holds the mutex and is

waiting for the someone to signal full. The producer could signal full but

is waiting for the mutex. Thus, the producer and consumer are each stuck

waiting for each other: a classic deadlock.

Finally, A Working Solution

To solve this problem, we simply must reduce the scope of the lock. Fig-

ure 31.12 shows the final working solution. As you can see, we simply

```c
     move the mutex acquire and release to be just around the critical section;
```

the full and empty wait and signal code is left outside. The result is a

simple and working bounded buffer, a commonly-used pattern in multi-

threaded programs. Understand it now; use it later. You will thank us for

years to come. Or at least, you will thank us when the same question is

asked on the final exam.

## 31.5 Reader-Writer Locks

Another classic problem stems from the desire for a more flexible lock-

ing primitive that admits that different data structure accesses might re-

quire different kinds of locking. For example, imagine a number of con-

current list operations, including inserts and simple lookups. While in-

serts change the state of the list (and thus a traditional critical section

makes sense), lookups simply read the data structure; as long as we can

guarantee that no insert is on-going, we can allow many lookups to pro-

ceed concurrently. The special type of lock we will now develop to sup-

port this type of operation is known as a reader-writer lock [CHP71]. The

code for such a lock is available in Figure 31.13.

The code is pretty simple. If some thread wants to update the data

structure in question, it should call the new pair of synchronization op-

erations: rwlock acquire writelock(), to acquire a write lock, and

rwlock release writelock(), to release it. Internally, these simply

use the writelock semaphore to ensure that only a single writer can ac-

```c
 1   typedef struct _rwlock_t {
 2     sem_t lock;      // binary semaphore (basic lock)
 3     sem_t writelock; // used to allow ONE writer or MANY readers
 4     int   readers;   // count of readers reading in critical section
 5   } rwlock_t;
 7   void rwlock_init(rwlock_t *rw) {
 8     rw->readers = 0;
 9     sem_init(&rw->lock, 0, 1);
10     sem_init(&rw->writelock, 0, 1);
11   }
13   void rwlock_acquire_readlock(rwlock_t *rw) {
14     sem_wait(&rw->lock);
15     rw->readers++;
16     if (rw->readers == 1)
17       sem_wait(&rw->writelock); // first reader acquires writelock
18     sem_post(&rw->lock);
19   }
21   void rwlock_release_readlock(rwlock_t *rw) {
22     sem_wait(&rw->lock);
23     rw->readers--;
24     if (rw->readers == 0)
25       sem_post(&rw->writelock); // last reader releases writelock
26     sem_post(&rw->lock);
27   }
29   void rwlock_acquire_writelock(rwlock_t *rw) {
30     sem_wait(&rw->writelock);
31   }
33   void rwlock_release_writelock(rwlock_t *rw) {
34     sem_post(&rw->writelock);
35   }
```
*Figure 31.13: A Simple Reader-Writer Lock*

quire the lock and thus enter the critical section to update the data struc-

ture in question.

More interesting is the pair of routines to acquire and release read

locks. When acquiring a read lock, the reader first acquires lock and

then increments the readers variable to track how many readers are

currently inside the data structure. The important step then taken within

rwlock acquire readlock() occurs when the first reader acquires

the lock; in that case, the reader also acquires the write lock by calling

sem wait() on the writelock semaphore, and then finally releasing

the lock by calling sem post().

Thus, once a reader has acquired a read lock, more readers will be

allowed to acquire the read lock too; however, any thread that wishes to

acquire the write lock will have to wait until all readers are finished; the

last one to exit the critical section calls sem post() on “writelock” and

thus enables a waiting writer to acquire the lock.

This approach works (as desired), but does have some negatives, espe-

> **TIP: SIMPLE AND DUMB CAN BE BETTER (H ILL’ SL AW)**
>
> You should never underestimate the notion that the simple and dumb approach can be the best one. With locking, sometimes a simple spin lock works best, because it is easy to implement and fast. Although something like reader/writer locks sounds cool, they are complex, and complex can mean slow. Thus, always try the simple and dumb approach first. This idea, of appealing to simplicity, is found in many places. One early source is Mark Hill’s dissertation [H87], which studied how to design caches for CPUs. Hill found that simple direct-mapped caches worked better than fancy set-associative designs (one reason is that in caching, simpler designs enable faster lookups). As Hill succinctly summarized his work: “Big and dumb is better.” And thus we call this similar advice Hill’s Law.

cially when it comes to fairness. In particular, it would be relatively easy for readers to starve writers. More sophisticated solutions to this problem exist; perhaps you can think of a better implementation? Hint: think about what you would need to do to prevent more readers from entering the lock once a writer is waiting.

Finally, it should be noted that reader-writer locks should be used with some caution. They often add more overhead (especially with more sophisticated implementations), and thus do not end up speeding up performance as compared to just using simple and fast locking primitives [CB08]. Either way, they showcase once again how we can use semaphores in an interesting and useful way.

## 31.6 The Dining Philosophers

One of the most famous concurrency problems posed, and solved, by Dijkstra, is known as the dining philosopher’s problem [D71]. The prob-

```c
lem is famous because it is fun and somewhat intellectually interesting;
```

however, its practical utility is low. However, its fame forces its inclusion here; indeed, you might be asked about it on some interview, and you’d really hate your OS professor if you miss that question and don’t get the job. Conversely, if you get the job, please feel free to send your OS professor a nice note, or some stock options.

The basic setup for the problem is this (as shown in Figure 31.14): assume there are five “philosophers” sitting around a table. Between each pair of philosophers is a single fork (and thus, five total). The philosophers each have times where they think, and don’t need any forks, and times where they eat. In order to eat, a philosopher needs two forks, both the one on their left and the one on their right. The contention for these forks, and the synchronization problems that ensue, are what makes this a problem we study in concurrent programming.
```text
f2         P1
P2                               f1
f3                                         P0
P3                               f0
f4         P4
```

*Figure 31.14: The Dining Philosophers*

Here is the basic loop of each philosopher:

```c
  while (1) {
    think();
    getforks();
    eat();
    putforks();
  }
```

The key challenge, then, is to write the routines getforks() and putforks() such that there is no deadlock, no philosopher starves and never gets to eat, and concurrency is high (i.e., as many philosophers can eat at the same time as possible).

Following Downey’s solutions [D08], we’ll use a few helper functions to get us towards a solution. They are:

```c
int left(int p) { return p; }
int right(int p) { return (p + 1) % 5; }
```

When philosopher p wishes to refer to the fork on their left, they simply call left(p). Similarly, the fork on the right of a philosopher p is referred to by calling right(p); the modulo operator therein handles the one case where the last philosopher (p=4) tries to grab the fork on their right, which is fork 0.

We’ll also need some semaphores to solve this problem. Let us assume we have five, one for each fork: sem t forks[5].

```c
1     void getforks() {
2       sem_wait(forks[left(p)]);
3       sem_wait(forks[right(p)]);
4     }
6     void putforks() {
7       sem_post(forks[left(p)]);
8       sem_post(forks[right(p)]);
9     }
```
*Figure 31.15: The getforks() And putforks() Routines*

Broken Solution We attempt our first solution to the problem. Assume we initialize each semaphore (in the forks array) to a value of 1. Assume also that each philosopher knows its own number (p). We can thus write the getforks() and putforks() routine as shown in Figure 31.15.

The intuition behind this (broken) solution is as follows. To acquire the forks, we simply grab a “lock” on each one: first the one on the left, and then the one on the right. When we are done eating, we release them. Simple, no? Unfortunately, in this case, simple means broken. Can you see the problem that arises? Think about it.

The problem is deadlock. If each philosopher happens to grab the fork on their left before any philosopher can grab the fork on their right, each will be stuck holding one fork and waiting for another, forever. Specifically, philosopher 0 grabs fork 0, philosopher 1 grabs fork 1, philosopher

```c
2 grabs fork 2, philosopher 3 grabs fork 3, and philosopher 4 grabs fork 4;
```

all the forks are acquired, and all the philosophers are stuck waiting for a fork that another philosopher possesses. We’ll study deadlock in more detail soon; for now, it is safe to say that this is not a working solution.

A Solution: Breaking The Dependency The simplest way to attack this problem is to change how forks are acquired by at least one of the philosophers; indeed, this is how Dijkstra himself solved the problem. Specifically, let’s assume that philosopher 4 (the highest numbered one) acquires the forks in a different order. The code to do so is as follows:

```c
1     void getforks() {
2       if (p == 4) {
3         sem_wait(forks[right(p)]);
4         sem_wait(forks[left(p)]);
5       } else {
6         sem_wait(forks[left(p)]);
7         sem_wait(forks[right(p)]);
8       }
9     }
```

Because the last philosopher tries to grab right before left, there is no situation where each philosopher grabs one fork and is stuck waiting for another; the cycle of waiting is broken. Think through the ramifications of this solution, and convince yourself that it works.

```c
1   typedef struct __Zem_t {
2       int value;
3       pthread_cond_t cond;
4       pthread_mutex_t lock;
5   } Zem_t;
7   // only one thread can call this
8   void Zem_init(Zem_t *s, int value) {
9       s->value = value;
10       Cond_init(&s->cond);
11       Mutex_init(&s->lock);
12   }
14   void Zem_wait(Zem_t *s) {
15       Mutex_lock(&s->lock);
16       while (s->value <= 0)
17           Cond_wait(&s->cond, &s->lock);
18       s->value--;
19       Mutex_unlock(&s->lock);
20   }
22   void Zem_post(Zem_t *s) {
23       Mutex_lock(&s->lock);
24       s->value++;
25       Cond_signal(&s->cond);
26       Mutex_unlock(&s->lock);
27   }
```
*Figure 31.16: Implementing Zemaphores With Locks And CVs*

There are other “famous” problems like this one, e.g., the cigarette smoker’s problem or the sleeping barber problem. Most of them are just excuses to think about concurrency; some of them have fascinating names. Look them up if you are interested in learning more, or just getting more practice thinking in a concurrent manner [D08].

## 31.7 How To Implement Semaphores

Finally, let’s use our low-level synchronization primitives, locks and condition variables, to build our own version of semaphores called ... (drum roll here) ... Zemaphores. This task is fairly straightforward, as you can see in Figure 31.16.

As you can see from the figure, we use just one lock and one condition variable, plus a state variable to track the value of the semaphore. Study the code for yourself until you really understand it. Do it!

One subtle difference between our Zemaphore and pure semaphores as defined by Dijkstra is that we don’t maintain the invariant that the value of the semaphore, when negative, reflects the number of waiting threads; indeed, the value will never be lower than zero. This behavior is easier to implement and matches the current Linux implementation.

Curiously, building locks and condition variables out of semaphores

> **TIP: BE CAREFUL WITH GENERALIZATION**
>
> The abstract technique of generalization can thus be quite useful in systems design, where one good idea can be made slightly broader and thus solve a larger class of problems. However, be careful when generalizing; as Lampson warns us “Don’t generalize; generalizations are generally wrong” [L83]. One could view semaphores as a generalization of locks and condition variables; however, is such a generalization needed? And, given the difficulty of realizing a condition variable on top of a semaphore, perhaps this generalization is not as general as you might think.

is a much trickier proposition. Some highly experienced concurrent programmers tried to do this in the Windows environment, and many different bugs ensued [B04]. Try it yourself, and see if you can figure out why building condition variables out of semaphores is more challenging than it might appear.

## 31.8 Summary

Semaphores are a powerful and flexible primitive for writing concurrent programs. Some programmers use them exclusively, shunning locks and condition variables, due to their simplicity and utility.

In this chapter, we have presented just a few classic problems and solutions. If you are interested in finding out more, there are many other materials you can reference. One great (and free reference) is Allen Downey’s book on concurrency and programming with semaphores [D08]. This book has lots of puzzles you can work on to improve your understanding of both semaphores in specific and concurrency in general. Becoming a real concurrency expert takes years of effort; going beyond what you learn in this class is undoubtedly the key to mastering such a topic.
